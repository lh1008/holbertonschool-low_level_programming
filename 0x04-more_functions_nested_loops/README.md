# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

### Learning Objectives


- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra`
- What are header files and how to to use them with `#include`

## Tasks

_**0. isupper**_  
- Write a function that checks for uppercase character.  

_**1. isdigit**_  
- Write a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).  

_**2. Collaboration is multiplication**_  
- Write a function that multiplies two integers.  

_**3. The numbers speak for themselves**_  
- Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.  

_**4. I believe in numbers and signs**_  
- Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.  

_**5. Numbers constitute the only universal language**_  
- Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.  

_**6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line**_  
- Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.  

_**7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe**_  
- Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.  

_**8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch**_  
- Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

_**9. Fizz-Buzz**_  
- The Fizz-Buzz test is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who cant seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.  

_**10. Triangles**_  
- Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
