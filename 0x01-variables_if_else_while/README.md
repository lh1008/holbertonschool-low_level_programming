### Tasks

_**0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**_
This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.

_**1. The last digit**_
This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

_**2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**_
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

_**3. alphABET*_
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

_**4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**_
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

_**5. Numbers**_
Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

_**6. Numberz**_
Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

_**7. Smile in the mirror**_
Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

_**8. Hexadecimal**_
Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
