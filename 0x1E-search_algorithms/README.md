### Tasks

_**0. Linear search**_  
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the [Linear search algorithm](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/60Mr-aRkqqgLCHEF9HZ64A)  

_**1. Binary search**_  
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the [Binary search algorithm](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/WyWx1D9mcUcAwpEA2ifkeQ)  

_**2. Big O #0**_  
What is the `time complexity` (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size `n`?  

_**3. Big O #1**_  
What is the `space complexity` (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size `n`?  

_**4. Big O #2**_  
What is the `time complexity` (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size `n`?  

_**5. Big O #3**_  
What is the `space complexity` (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size `n`?  

_**6. Big O #4**_  
What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
